# Lossless Scaling

**All-in-one gaming utility for scaling and frame generation**

## What is Lossless Scaling?

Lossless Scaling allows you to scale windowed games to full screen using the state-of-the-art scaling algorithms, as well as use ML based proprietary scaling and frame generation.

### Frame generation options:
- LSFG

### Scaling options:
- LS1
- AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution
- NVIDIA Image Scaling
- Integer Scaling
- Nearest Neighbor
- xBR
- Anime4K
- Sharp Bilinear
- Bicubic CAS

The latest feature allows you to use Lossless Scaling to generate additional frames in games that do not have such support, including emulators.

Lossless Scaling is also useful for:
- Upscaling modern games if you cannot run them at native screen resolution (GPU limited)
- Getting rid of blur due to bilinear scaling of the GPU driver
- Upscaling older and pixel-art games which do not support modern screen resolutions or full screen mode

**Recommendations:**
- For modern games: use LS1 or AMD FSR
- For pixel-art games: use Integer Scaling or xBR
- For cartoons/anime: use Anime4K

## Requirements:
- Scaling makes sense when you are limited by GPU power
- For best experience, limit the game to a stable frame rate so Lossless Scaling has resources to work with
- The game must be running in windowed mode
- Windows 10 1903 or newer
